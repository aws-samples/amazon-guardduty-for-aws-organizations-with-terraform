# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub Issue Tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure someone else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly valuable:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of our code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Request

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. Ensure you are working against the latest source on the `main` branch
2. Check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already
3. Open an issue to discuss any significant work. (We would hate for your time to be wasted!)

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Modify the source, focusing on the specific change you are contributing (if you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change)
3. Ensure local tests pass
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages
5. Send a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding Contributions

Reviewing any existing issues is a great way to find an area that needs contributions. Our project uses the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix). Also, look for any `help wanted` issues for a great place to start.
